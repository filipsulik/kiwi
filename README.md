## How to use

Now you can input digits into the input either using your keyboard,
or the UI keyboard. Once you input some digits the app will suggest
real english words + all combinations that can be made from the digits
you supplied. The strings that are not real words can be saved as real words
using the "+ add to dictionary" button. Once some strings are saved as
real words they will always be shown as real, because they get saved to
database as real words. You can click on any suggested string to render it as a text.
